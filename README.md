Tutorial for learning state machines using smach, 


# What is smach
* SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior. 
* At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build hierarchical state machines. 
* SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular code.
